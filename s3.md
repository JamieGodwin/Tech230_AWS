## Working in the terminal on pycharm
- We first make a file called AWS, the cd into it
- We can the create a sampletext.txt file
- We then need to install aws. We do the command `pip install awscli`
- This will then ask you for your key and location information. 
- We can then look at the contents of the s3 we have accessed with the cmmand ` aws s3 ls `
- We can then create a bucket with the command ` aws s3 mb s3://tech230-jamie-bucket --region eu-west-1 `
- We can then add a file to this with ` aws s3 cp sampletext.txt s3://tech230-jamie-bucket `
- We can download the content into a file called "s3_downloads" with ` aws s3 sync s3://tech230-jamie-bucket s3_downloads `
- In order to delete a bucket, it must be empty, so we do this by ` aws s3 rm s3://tech230-jamie-bucket/sampletext.txt `
- The command ` aws s3 rm s3://tech230-jamie-bucket --recursive ` removes everything. 
- We can then remove the bucket by ` aws s3 rb s3://tech230-jamie-bucket  `

## Working in python
- We frst need to install boto3 in the terminal with ` pip install boto3 `
### View the buckets
` import boto3 `

` # Connect to s3 `

`s3 = boto3.resource("s3")`

`# lists buckets`

`for bucket in s3.buckets.all():`
   ` print(bucket.name) `

### Creating a bucket
`import boto3`

`# connect`

`s3 = boto3.client("s3")`

`# Create a bucket on s3`

`bucket_name = s3.create_bucket(Bucket="tech230-jamie-boto", CreateBucketConfiguration={"LocationConstraint":"eu-west-1"})`

`print(bucket_name)`
### Upload a file to the bucket
`import boto3`

`# Connect`
`s3 = boto3.resource("s3")`

`# Open the file we want to send, store it in a variable called data`

`data = open("sampletext.txt", "rb")`

`# Specify what bucket we're sending the file to, put_object names file and send its contents`

`s3.Bucket("tech230-jamie-boto").put_object(Key="sampletext.txt", Body=data)`
### Download from bucket
`import boto3`

`s3 = boto3.client("s3")`

`# Download from s3 bucket`
`s3.download_file("tech230-jamie-boto", "sampletext.txt", "sampletext1")`
### Delete from the bucket
`import boto3`

`s3 = boto3.resource("s3")`

`# Delete object in bucket`

`s3.Object("tech230-jamie-boto","sampletext.txt").delete()`
### Delete the bucket
`import boto3`

`s3 = boto3.resource("s3")`

`# Import the bucket`
`bucket = s3.Bucket("tech230-jamie-boto")`

`# Delete the bucket`
`response = bucket.delete()`
